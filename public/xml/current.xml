Frank (Ernest Borgnine), Ella (Anne Meara), Alice (Doris Roberts) and June (Piper Laurie) gather each morning for a game of cards. They have become like family to one another, offering unyielding support, constant bickering and strong opinions about life, death and everything in between. One morning Frank reveals to Ella that he no longer remembers his wife’s face and that he doesn’t want to live to endure another debilitating stroke. He persuades his son Jeffrey (Richard Schiff) to give him his old gun because by holding it he finds a way to remember his World War II buddies. But perhaps he has another motive for wanting the weapon. Frank’s revelation sets off a struggle between Ella and the ever-optimistic Alice as they both try to affect his decision while privately dealing with their own fears. That Labor Day Jeffrey, daughter Vickie (Cybill Shepherd) and grandson Jack (Cameron Monaghan) take Frank on a camping trip where his spirits are lifted. Back at the nursing home Frank ponders his decision and his next move. His friends and family must confront their own feelings about faith, dignity and our obligations to our loved ones. Another Harvest Moon deals with weighty issues affecting us all. </description></info><cast><name>Ernest Borgnine</name><name>Piper Laurie</name><name>Anne Meara</name><name>Doris Roberts</name><name>Richard Schiff</name><name>Cybill Shepherd</name><name>Sunkrish Bala</name><name>Amber Benson</name><name>Clay Bravo</name><name>Cameron Monaghan</name><name>Dale Waddington Horowitz</name><name>Candace O’Donnell</name><name>Liz Rebert</name><name>Allie Swartz</name><name>Kate Caffrey</name><name>Kevin Spangler</name><name>Michael Zinn</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/anotherharvestmoon/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/anotherharvestmoon/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="18790470">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/anotherharvestmoon/anotherharvestmoon-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4156"><info><title>Apollo 18</title><runtime>2:29</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>Weinstein Company</studio><postdate>2011-02-18</postdate><releasedate>2012-01-06</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2012 Weinstein Company</copyright><director>Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego</director><description>Officially, Apollo 17, launched December 17th, 1972, was the last manned mission to the moon.

Having divorced her husband, Christian (Michael Falch), and relinquished custody of their two boys during her heavy drinking days, Thea wants to start over. As her past alcohol use and indiscretions still haunt her, the reality of a new beginning seems bleak. Thea uses her inner actress’s charm and manipulation to convince her ex-husband that she is fully recovered and capable of being a good mother to their children; however, she hasn’t completely convinced herself. On stage, Thea plays the binge drinking, ostentatious Martha in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” Ironically, her stage character bears an uncanny resemblance to her personal life. As her alcoholism and past regrets hang in the balance, Thea must decide whether to confront her inner demons or to let the show go on. </description></info><cast><name>Paprika Steen</name><name>Michael Falch</name><name>Sara-Marie Maltha</name><name>Shanti Roney</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/applause/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/applause/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="22393223">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/applause/applause-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4160"><info><title>Arthur</title><runtime>2:30</runtime><rating>PG-13</rating><studio>Warner Bros.

This new love floods Oliver with memories of his father who - following 44 years of marriage - came out of the closet at age 75 to live a full, energized, and wonderfully tumultuous gay life.

Sometimes, you will.” So says Buck Brannaman, a true American cowboy and sage on horseback who travels the country for nine grueling months a year helping horses with people problems. BUCK follows Brannaman from his abusive childhood to his phenomenally successful approach to horses. A real-life “horse-whisperer”, he eschews the violence of his upbringing and teaches people to communicate with their horses through leadership and sensitivity, not punishment. Buck possesses near magical abilities as he dramatically transforms horses - and people - with his understanding, compassion and respect. In this film, the animal-human relationship becomes a metaphor for facing the daily challenges of life.

Arizona Territory. A stranger (Craig) with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. The only hint to his history is a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don’t welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford). It’s a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Screaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever known. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he’s been, he realizes he holds a secret that could give the town a fighting chance against the alien force. With the help of the elusive traveler Ella (Olivia Wilde), he pulls together a posse comprised of former opponents—townsfolk, Dolarhyde and his boys, outlaws and Apache warriors—all in danger of annihilation.  United against a common enemy, they will prepare for an epic showdown for survival.</description></info><cast><name>Daniel Craig</name><name>Harrison Ford</name><name>Olivia Wilde</name><name>Sam Rockwell</name></cast><genre><name>Science Fiction</name><name>Action and Adventure</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/universal/cowboysandaliens/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/universal/cowboysandaliens/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="25493406">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/universal/cowboysandaliens/cowboysaliens-tlr2_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4233"><info><title>Crazy, Stupid, Love.</title><runtime>2:27</runtime><rating>PG-13</rating><studio>Warner Bros.

But when Cal learns that his wife, Emily (Julianne Moore), has cheated on him and wants a divorce, his “perfect” life quickly unravels.  Worse, in today’s single world, Cal, who hasn’t dated in decades, stands out as the epitome of un-smooth.  Now spending his free evenings sulking alone at a local bar, the hapless Cal is taken on as wingman and protege to handsome, thirtysomething player Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling).  In an effort to help Cal get over his wife and start living his life, Jacob opens Cal’s eyes to the many options before him: flirty women, manly drinks and a sense of style that can’t be found at Supercuts or The Gap.  Cal and Emily aren’t the only ones looking for love in what might be all the wrong places: Cal’s 13-year-old son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo), is crazy about his 17-year-old babysitter, Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), who harbors a crush on Cal.  And despite Cal’s makeover and his many new conquests, the one thing that can’t be made over is his heart, which seems to keep leading him back to where he began.</description></info><cast><name>Steve Carell</name><name>Ryan Gosling</name><name>Julianne Moore</name><name>Emma Stone</name><name>John Carroll Lynch</name><name>Marisa Tomei,</name><name>Kevin Bacon</name><name>Jonah Bobo</name><name>Analeigh Tipton</name><name>Josh Groban</name><name>Liza Lapira</name><name>Joey King</name></cast><genre><name>Comedy</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/wb/crazystupidlove/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/wb/crazystupidlove/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="21583328">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/wb/crazystupidlove/crazystupidlove-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4261"><info><title>Daydream Nation</title><runtime>2:03</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>Anchor Bay Films</studio><postdate>2011-04-14</postdate><releasedate>2011-05-06</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Anchor Bay Films</copyright><director>Michael Goldbach</director><description>Seventeen-year-old Caroline Wexler (Kat Dennings) is facing a teenager’s nightmare: her widowed father has moved them from the big city to a tiny town in the middle of nowhere.

Protectors of peace and justice, they are called the Green Lantern Corps. A brotherhood of warriors sworn to keep intergalactic order, each Green Lantern wears a ring that grants him superpowers. But when a new enemy called Parallax threatens to destroy the balance of power in the Universe, their fate and the fate of Earth lie in the hands of their newest recruit, the first human ever selected: Hal Jordan.  Hal is a gifted and cocky test pilot, but the Green Lanterns have little respect for humans, who have never harnessed the infinite powers of the ring before. But Hal is clearly the missing piece to the puzzle, and along with his determination and willpower, he has one thing no member of the Corps has ever had: humanity. With the encouragement of fellow pilot and childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), if Hal can quickly master his new powers and find the courage to overcome his fears, he may prove to be not only the key to defeating Parallax…he will become the greatest Green Lantern of all.</description></info><cast><name>Ryan Reynolds</name><name>Blake Lively</name><name>Peter Sarsgaard</name><name>Mark Strong</name><name>Jay O.

He gets his wakeup call early one morning when he becomes an unwitting participant in an ill-conceived bank heist.  Rather than give up the names of the real culprits, Henry takes the fall and goes to jail. There, he meets the irrepressible Max  , a con man who’s grown far too comfortable with the familiarity and security of his ‘idyllic’ life behind bars, but one who also helps plant an idea in Henry’s mind which will change his life forever: for a man to find his purpose, he must first have a dream.  Upon his release one year later, Henry finds his purpose. Having done the time, he decides he may as well do the crime. Discovering a long forgotten bootlegger’s tunnel which runs from the very same bank to a theater across the alleyway, he convinces the reluctant Max to file for his long overdue parole — and then recruits his former cellmate to help stage a robbery.  Their plan is simple: by infiltrating the theater and its current production of Chekhov’s, The Cherry Orchard, the unlikely duo will buy just enough time to dig their way to the adjacent bank vault and drive off with their loot. Unfortunately that plan also includes Henry taking the lead role in the play, where he finds himself slowly falling for the production’s mercurial leading lady, Julie.</description></info><cast><name>Keanu Reeves</name><name>James Caan</name><name>Vera Farmiga</name></cast><genre><name>Comedy</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/henryscrime/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/henryscrime/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="22631053">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/henryscrime/henryscrime-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4225"><info><title>Hobo With A Shotgun</title><runtime>1:32</runtime><rating>NR</rating><studio>Magnolia Pictures</studio><postdate>2011-03-29</postdate><releasedate>2011-05-06</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Magnolia Pictures</copyright><director>Jason Eisener</director><description>A train pulls into its final station and a Hobo hops from a freight car. He has dreams of a fresh life in a new city, but finds himself trapped in an urban hell instead. A city where criminals rule the streets, landlords evict single mothers in the middle of the night, and where the city’s crime boss, The Drake, reigns supreme with his sadistic, homeless-killing sons, Slick &amp; Ivan. Through the chaos, the Hobo comes across a shop window displaying a second hand lawn mower and a shotgun, and decides it’s time to cut the grass, make the city beautiful and start a new way of life.

HOOD VS.  EVIL in 3D.  The sequel finds our heroine, Red (Hayden Panettiere), training with a mysterious covert group called the Sisters of the Hood.  But Red is forced to cut her training short when she gets an urgent call from Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers), who returns as head of the super-secret Happily Ever After Agency, aka the HEA.  A wicked witch (Joan Cusack) has abducted two innocent children, Hansel (Bill Hader) and Gretel (Amy Poehler), and Nicky needs Red for the search-and-rescue mission.    Of course, what is a sequel without guest stars from the original?  Thankfully, Granny (Glenn Close) and the rest of the HOODWINKED gang—including the ever-clueless Wolf (Patrick Warburton) and his over-caffeinated little partner, Twitchy (Cory Edwards), join Red to solve the forest’s latest caper.  Fracturing fairy tales and pop culture with good-natured glee, HOODWINKED  TOO!

The story begins in war-torn Jerusalem in 1948 when Hind Husseini (HIAM ABBASS, The Visitor, Amreeka) opens an orphanage for refugee children that quickly becomes home to 2000 orphans. One of the children is seventeen year old Miral (FRIEDA PINTO, Slumdog Millionaire) who arrived at the orphanage 10 years earlier, following her mother’s tragic death. On the cusp of the Intifada resistance, Miral is assigned to teach at a refugee camp where she falls for a fervent political activist, Hani (OMAR METWALLY, Munich, Rendition) and finds herself in a personal battle that mirrors the greater dilemma around her: to fight like those before her or follow Mama Hind’s defiant belief that education will pave a road to peace.</description></info><cast><name>Hiam Abbass</name><name>Frieda Pinto</name><name>Omar Metwally</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name><name>Foreign</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/weinstein/miral/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/weinstein/miral/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="19751869">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/weinstein/miral/miral-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4286"><info><title>Page One: Inside The New York Times</title><runtime>2:28</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>Magnolia Pictures</studio><postdate>2011-05-02</postdate><releasedate>2011-06-24</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Magnolia Pictures</copyright><director>Andrew Rossi</director><description>Andrew Rossi’s riveting documentary Page One: Inside The New York Times had its World Premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, and was acquired by Magnolia Pictures and Participant Media for theatrical release this June. In the tradition of great fly-on-the-wall documentaries, the film deftly gains unprecedented access to the New York Times newsroom and the inner workings of the Media Desk. With the Internet surpassing print as our main news source and newspapers all over the country going bankrupt, Page One chronicles the transformation of the media industry at its time of greatest turmoil. Writers like Brian Stelter, Tim Arango and the salty but brilliant David Carr track print journalism’s metamorphosis even as their own paper struggles to stay vital and solvent, while their editors and publishers grapple with up-to-the-minute issues like controversial new sources and the implications of an online pay-wall. Meanwhile, rigorous journalism is thriving—Page One gives us an up-close look at the vibrant cross-cubicle debates and collaborations, tenacious jockeying for on-record quotes, and skillful page-one pitching that brings the most venerable newspaper in America to fruition each and every day. </description></info><genre><name>Documentary</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/magnolia/pageoneinsidethenewyorktimes/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/magnolia/pageoneinsidethenewyorktimes/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="25411106">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/magnolia_pictures/pageone/pageone-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4253"><info><title>Passion Play</title><runtime>1:38</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>Image Entertainment</studio><postdate>2011-04-14</postdate><releasedate>2011-05-06</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Image Entertainment</copyright><director>Mitch Glazer</director><description>A terrific cast will hold you spellbound in this one of a kind seductive thriller from the screenwriter of The Recruit.

Catherine Deneuve is Suzanne Pujol, a submissive, housebound ‘trophy housewife’ (or  “potiche,”) who steps in to manage her wealthy and tyrannical husband (Fabrice Lucchini)’s umbrella factory after the workers go on strike and take him hostage. To everyone’s surprise, Suzanne proves herself a competent and assertive woman of action. But when her husband returns from a restful cruise in top form, things get complicated. Gerard Depardieu plays a former union leader and Suzanne’s ex-beau who still holds a flame for her.  Acclaimed writer-director Francois Ozon (“Swimming Pool,” “Under the Sand,” “Time to Leave,”) who had previously directed Ms. Deneuve in “8 Women,” twists the original play on its head to create his own satirical and hilarious take on the war between the sexes and classes.</description></info><cast><name>Catherine Deneuve</name><name>Gérard Depardieu</name><name>Fabrice Luchini</name><name>Karin Viard</name><name>Judith Godreche</name></cast><genre><name>Comedy</name><name>Foreign</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/potiche/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/potiche/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="21871303">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/potiche/potiche-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3998"><info><title>Priest</title><runtime>1:21</runtime><rating>PG-13</rating><studio>Sony Pictures</studio><postdate>2011-04-19</postdate><releasedate>2011-05-13</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Sony Pictures</copyright><director>Scott Stewart</director><description>PRIEST, a western-fused post-apocalyptic thriller, is set in an alternate world — one ravaged by centuries of war between man and vampires.

When his niece (Lily Collins) is abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on an obsessive quest to find her before they turn her into one of them.

When Blu discovers there’s another - and that she’s a she - he leaves the comforts of his cage in small town Minnesota and heads to Rio. But it’s far from love at first sight between the domesticated and flight-challenged Blu and the fiercely independent, high-flying female, Jewel. Unexpectedly thrown together, they embark on an adventure of a lifetime, where they learn about friendship, love, courage, and being open to life’s many wonders. RIO brings together a menagerie of vivid characters, a heart-warming story, colorful backdrops, energizing Latin and contemporary music, and family-friendly song and dance.</description></info><cast><name>Jesse Eisenberg</name><name>Anne Hathaway</name><name>Jamie Foxx</name><name>will.i.am</name><name>Tracy Morgan</name><name>George Lopez</name><name>Jane Lynch</name><name>Wanda Sykes</name><name>Leslie Mann</name><name>Jermanine Clement</name><name>Rodrigo Santoro</name></cast><genre><name>Family</name><name>Comedy</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox/rio/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox/rio/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="24443792">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/fox/rio/rio-tlr2_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4260"><info><title>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</title><runtime>1:54</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>20th Century Fox</studio><postdate>2011-04-14</postdate><releasedate>2011-08-05</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 20th Century Fox</copyright><director>Rupert Wyatt</director><description>A single act of both compassion and arrogance leads to a war unlike any other — and to the RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES.

He finds himself unsuspectingly drawn into a complex web of haunting intrigue, obsessed with the woman, the crime, her possibly notorious past and the disturbing complexity between art and truth.

As Robert roams the bleak landscape, he discovers that he possesses terrifying telepathic powers that give him the ability to destroy anything he wishes without having to move. At first content to prey on small desert creatures and various discarded objects, his attention soon turns to humans, especially a beautiful and mysterious woman who crosses his path. Leaving a swath of destruction across the desert landscape, Robert becomes a chaotic force to be reckoned with, and truly a movie villain for the ages. Directed by legendary electro musician Quentin Dupieux (Steak, Nonfilm), aka Mr. Oizo, RUBBER is a smart, funny and wholly original tribute to the cinematic concept of no reason.</description></info><cast><name>Stephen Spinella</name><name>Roxane Mesquida</name><name>Jack Plotnick</name><name>Wings Hauser</name></cast><genre><name>Comedy</name><name>Horror</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/rubber/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/rubber/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="24794673">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/rubber/rubber-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4002"><info><title>Scream 4</title><runtime>2:29</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>Dimension Films</studio><postdate>2011-01-20</postdate><releasedate>2011-04-15</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Dimension Films</copyright><director>Wes Craven</director><description>New decade.

A story syncopated with moments of violent turbulence, of heartbreak and of new beginnings, Skateland immerses the audience in the brutal, but beautiful vastness of East Texas blue skies and the emotional claustrophobia of the Bible belt.  Enveloped by the brooding melodies and incendiary rock riffs of the early 80’s, Skateland is a place where aging values wrestle with contemporary pop culture to create a paradoxical balance between old and new.</description></info><cast><name>Ashley Greene</name><name>Shiloh Fernandez    </name><name>Heath Freeman</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/skateland/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/skateland/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="19078230">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/skateland/skateland-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4197"><info><title>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</title><runtime>2:02</runtime><rating>PG-13</rating><studio>Fox Searchlight Pictures</studio><postdate>2011-03-11</postdate><releasedate>2011-07-15</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Fox Searchlight Pictures</copyright><director>Wayne Wang</director><description>Inspired by the bestselling novel SNOW FLOWER AND THE SECRET FAN by Lisa See, the film is a timeless portrait of female friendship.  In 19th-century China, seven-year-old girls Snow Flower and Lily are matched as laotong - or “old sames” - bound together for eternity.  Isolated by their families, they furtively communicate by taking turns writing in a secret language, nu shu, between the folds of a white silk fan.  In a parallel story in present day Shanghai, the laotong’s descendants, Nina and Sophia, struggle to maintain the intimacy of their own childhood friendship in the face of demanding careers, complicated love lives, and a relentlessly evolving Shanghai.  Drawing on the lessons of the past, the two modern women must understand the story of their ancestral connection, hidden from them in the folds of the antique white silk fan, or risk losing one another forever.  What unfolds are two stories, generations apart, but everlasting in their universal notion of love, hope and friendship.</description></info><genre><name>Drama</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/snowflowerandthesecretfan/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/snowflowerandthesecretfan/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="20400649">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/fox_searchlight/snowflower/snowflower-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4181"><info><title>Something Borrowed</title><runtime>2:28</runtime><rating>PG-13</rating><studio>Warner Bros.

In an assignment unlike any he’s ever known, he learns he’s part of a government experiment called the Source Code, a program that enables him to cross over into another man’s identity in the last 8 minutes of his life.  With a second, much larger target threatening to kill millions in downtown Chicago, Colter re-lives the incident over and over again, gathering clues each time, until he can solve the mystery of who is behind the bombs and prevent the next attack.  Filled with mind-boggling twists and heart-pounding suspense, Source Code is a smart action-thriller directed by Duncan Jones (Moon) also starring Michelle Monaghan (Eagle Eye, Due Date), Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air, The  Departed), and Jeffrey Wright (Quantum of Solace, Syriana). </description></info><cast><name>Jake Gyllenhaal</name><name>Michelle Monaghan</name><name>Vera Farmiga</name><name>Jeffrey Wright</name></cast><genre><name>Action and Adventure</name><name>Thriller</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/summit/sourcecode/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/summit/sourcecode/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="10105354">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/summit/sourcecode/sourcecode-tlr2_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4247"><info><title>Square Grouper</title><runtime>2:29</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>Magnolia Pictures</studio><postdate>2011-04-07</postdate><releasedate>2011-04-15</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Magnolia Pictures</copyright><director>Billy Corben</director><description>A colorful portrait of Miami’s pot smuggling scene of the 1970s, populated with redneck pirates, a ganja-smoking church, and the longest serving marijuana prisoner in American history.</description></info><genre><name>Drama</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/magnolia/squaregrouper/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/magnolia/squaregrouper/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="26062594">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/magnolia_pictures/squaregrouper/squaregrouper-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4269"><info><title>Submarine</title><runtime>2:10</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>Weinstein Company</studio><postdate>2011-04-21</postdate><releasedate>11-06-03</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Weinstein Company</copyright><director>Richard Ayoade</director><description>Fifteen-year-old Oliver Tate has two big ambitions: to save his parents’ marriage via carefully plotted intervention and to lose his virginity before his next birthday.

Director Zack Snyder and animator Ben Hibon collaborated with Comflix Studios to further explore the fantasy worlds in the film. The animated shorts provide a distinct glimpse into those surreal places, allowing people to experience the worlds in a very unique way. “It made sense to me to not only approach the worlds from an original direction in terms of story and focus,” says Snyder, “but also to really push the visual style in a different direction as well. Having seen his contribution to the latest Harry Potter film and looking at some of his other recent work, Ben’s talent was obvious and his aesthetic felt like a perfect fit.  His work is graphic and visually arresting.” Hibon relished an opportunity to expand upon Snyder’s unique vision.  “Zack is one of the most exciting and original directors working in Hollywood today. Sucker Punch is nothing short of pure visual madness.” DISTANT PLANET: In Sucker Punch, the girls find themselves on another planet battling a robot militia on a hijacked train.

Summoned from the frontline to Saddam Hussein’s palace, Iraqi army lieutenant Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper) is thrust into the highest echelons of the “royal family” when he’s ordered to become the ‘fiday’ - or body double - to Saddam’s son, the notorious “Black Prince” Uday Hussein (also Dominic Cooper), a reckless, sadistic party-boy with a rabid hunger for sex and brutality. With his and his family’s lives at stake, Latif must surrender his former self forever as he learns to walk, talk and act like Uday. But nothing could have prepared him for the horror of the Black Prince’s psychotic, drug-addled life of fast cars, easy women and impulsive violence. With one wrong move costing him his life, Latif forges an intimate bond with Sarrab (Ludivine Sangier), Uday’s seductive mistress who’s haunted by her own secrets. But as war looms with Kuwait and Uday’s depraved gangster regime threatens to destroy them all, Latif realizes that escape from the devil’s den will only come at the highest possible cost.  </description></info><cast><name>Dominic Cooper</name><name>Ludivine Sagnier</name><name>Raad Rawi</name><name>Philip Quast</name><name>Mimoun Oaissa</name><name>Khalid Laith</name><name>Dar Salim</name><name>Nasser Memarzia</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name><name>Action and Adventure</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/lions_gate/thedevilsdouble/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/lions_gate/thedevilsdouble/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="21803800">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/lionsgate/devilsdouble/devilsdouble-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4252"><info><title>The First Grader</title><runtime>2:09</runtime><rating>PG-13</rating><studio>National Geographic Entertainment</studio><postdate>2011-04-11</postdate><releasedate>2011-05-13</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 National Geographic Entertainment</copyright><director>Justin Chadwick</director><description>When an old villager insists on attending school so he can learn to read, everyone learns that it’s never too late to dream.</description></info><cast><name>Naomie Harris</name><name>Oliver Litondo</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name><name>Foreign</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/thefirstgrader/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/thefirstgrader/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="22008368">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/firstgrader/firstgrader-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4223"><info><title>The Greatest Movie Ever Sold</title><runtime>2:24</runtime><rating>PG-13</rating><studio>Sony Pictures Classics</studio><postdate>2011-03-25</postdate><releasedate>2011-04-22</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Sony Pictures Classics</copyright><director>Morgan Spurlock</director><description>Boundary-pushing Oscar(R)-nominated filmmaker Morgan Spurlock explores the world of product placement, marketing and advertising in POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold, a film that was fully financed through product placement from various brands, all of which are integrated transparently into the film. While using brands in film promotion is not new for Hollywood, it certainly is new territory for the documentary format. Spurlock exploits the phenomenon to new heights, with everything from branded pizza boxes and in-flight film promotions to branded-everything in-film. With humor and insight, POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold unmasks the marketing process to bring audiences behind closed doors directly into the pitch meetings and marketing presentations which ultimately inform our everyday entertainment decisions. Sponsors were provided with brand category exclusivity. The brands that agreed to sponsor the film placed Spurlock front and center in their brand campaigns and advertisements, both on and off-line. Partners have the unique right to promote themselves in association with Spurlock and the film as “The Greatest.” The agreements also stipulate that Spurlock maintains creative control of the film’s content and final edit.</description></info><cast><name>Morgan Spurlock</name></cast><genre><name>Comedy</name><name>Documentary</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/sony/thegreatestmovieeversold/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/sony/thegreatestmovieeversold/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="22254623">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/sony/greatestmovieeversold/greatestmovieeversold-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4172"><info><title>The Hangover Part II</title><runtime>2:26</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>Warner Bros.

It is a battle over protecting our health and environment from the destructive power of Big Coal. Mining and burning coal is at the epicenter of America’s struggle to balance its energy needs with environmental and health concerns. Nowhere is that concern greater than in Coal River Valley, West Virginia, where a small but passionate group of ordinary citizens are trying to stop Big Coal corporations, like Massey Energy, from continuing the devastating practice of Mountain Top Removal. David, himself, never faced a Goliath like Big Coal. The group argues that Mountain Top Removal-using dynamite to blast off a mountain’s surface-pollutes the air and water implicit in their neighbors’ deaths, eliminates traditional mining jobs and spreads pollution to other states. Despite support for their claims, Big Coal repeats Mountain Top Removal daily, amassing huge profits that allow their Washington lobbyists to wield influence in both political parties, rewrite environmental laws and avoid violations. The desire to stop Mountain Top Removal comes from a belief that we share responsibility for protecting the air and water; its what drives the group and their supporters from outside of Appalachia, like Robert Kennedy, Jr., to keep fighting. Honoring ordinary Americans fighting for what they believe in, THE LAST MOUNTAIN shines a light on our energy needs and how those needs are being met. Their fight is for a future that affects us all. </description></info><genre><name>Documentary</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/thelastmountain/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/thelastmountain/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="24731425">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/thelastmountain/thelastmountain-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4043"><info><title>The Lincoln Lawyer</title><runtime>2:26</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>Lionsgate</studio><postdate>2010-12-21</postdate><releasedate>2011-03-18</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Lionsgate</copyright><director>Brad Furman</director><description>Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey) is a Los Angeles criminal defense attorney who operates out of the back of his Lincoln sedan.

The film follows the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father (Brad Pitt).  Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn) finds himself a lost soul in the modern world, seeking answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith.   Through Malick’s signature imagery, we see how both brute nature and spiritual grace shape not only our lives as individuals and families, but all life.</description></info><cast><name>Brad Pitt</name><name>Sean Penn</name><name>Jessica Chastain</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name><name>Science Fiction</name><name>Fantasy</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/thetreeoflife/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/thetreeoflife/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="19243104">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/fox_searchlight/treeoflife/treeoflife-tlr_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4116"><info><title>There Be Dragons</title><runtime>2:30</runtime><rating>PG-13</rating><studio>Samuel Goldwyn Films</studio><postdate>2011-02-18</postdate><releasedate>2011-05-06</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Samuel Goldwyn Films</copyright><director>Roland Joffé</director><description>Starring Charlie Cox (STARDUST), Wes Bentley (AMERICAN BEAUTY), Olga Kurylenko (QUANTUM OF SOLACE), Emmy Award-winning actor Derek Jacobi (GLADIATOR), Dougray Scott (MISSION IMPOSSIBLE II) and Rodrigo Santoro (300), THERE BE DRAGONS tells the story of London-based investigative journalist Robert Torres (Dougray Scott), who visits Spain to research a book about Josemaria Escriva (Cox), the controversial founder of Opus Dei. But Robert hits a wall, both professionally and personally, when his most promising source—his own father, Manolo Torres (Bentley), turns out to be his least cooperative one. Robert begins to unearth his father’s toxic secrets when he learns that Manolo was not only born in the same Spanish town as Josemaria, but that they were childhood friends and attended the same seminary. The two men take radically different paths in life, with Josemaria dedicating his life to his faith while Manolo is swept into the brutal and tumultuous Spanish Civil War. Manolo descends into a dangerous and jealous obsession when the beautiful Hungarian revolutionary Ildiko (Olga Kurylenko) doesn’t return his affections and instead gives herself to the courageous military leader, Oriol (Rodrigo Santoro). As Robert continues to unearth the secrets of Josemaria’s life and Manolo’s mysterious anger, their overlapping journeys are revealed with the truths and sorrows of their past choices, which compels Manolo to confront his own secret with one last opportunity of forgiveness.</description></info><cast><name>Charlie Cox</name><name>Wes Bentley</name><name>Olga Kurylenko</name><name>Derek Jacobi</name><name>Dougray Scott</name><name>Rodrigo Santoro</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/therebedragons/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/therebedragons/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="24733706">http://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/therebedragons/therebedragons-tlr1_h640w.mov</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="4067"><info><title>Thor</title><runtime>2:27</runtime><rating>PG-13</rating><studio>Paramount Pictures</studio><postdate>2011-02-24</postdate><releasedate>2011-05-06</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2011 Paramount Pictures</copyright><director>Kenneth Branagh</director><description>The epic adventure “Thor” spans the Marvel Universe from present day Earth to the realm of Asgard.

So to improve his odds of living “happily ever after,” Harry decides to have an arranged marriage, and asks his uncle back home in India to assist him in arranging the introduction to an appropriate Indian woman. To the dismay of his parents and friends, Harry finds the perfect girl and embarks on a long-distance courtship. But unexpectedly, Harry’s friendship with Theresa, a fun and sexy American student, becomes confusing, appealing — and maybe a little bit romantic.
